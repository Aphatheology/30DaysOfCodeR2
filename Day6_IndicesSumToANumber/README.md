## Create a function that takes 2 inputs: an array of numbers and a target number. Your function should return the indices of the numbers that add up to form the target number. If no two numbers make up the target number, return -1, -1

### NB: All numbers in the array can only be used once to add up to the target.

### NB2: The indices should be returned in an array

- For example: 

- [1,9,4,5,3, 0] , 10 
    - The function output =>  [0,1]

 

- [2, 5, 9, 6, 1, 53, 45], 47 
    - The function output => [0,6]

 

- [4, 9, 3, 5, 0, 14, 10], 100 
    - The function output => [-1, -1]



## Things I learned from this Challenge

- I learned and practised how to remove duplicate members in an array
