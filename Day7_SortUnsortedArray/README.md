## Create a function that takes an array of unsorted numbers and sorts them.

### NB: You canâ€™t use the built-in sort function

 

- For example: 

    - [1,9,4,5,3, 0]  
        - The function output =>  [0,1,3,4,5,9]

 

    - [2,5,9,6,1,53, 45] 
        - The function output => [1,2,5,6,9,45,53]

 

    - [4,9,-3,5,0,-14,10] 
        - The function output  => [-14,-3,0,4,5,9,10]



## Things I learned from this Challenge

- I learned and practised how to remove duplicate members in an array
