## Create a function that takes 2 sorted arrays as its inputs. Merge both arrays and return the result array. The result array must be sorted as well.

### NB: You canâ€™t use the inbuilt sort function

 

- For example: 

    - [1,4,7,8] , [2,3,4]  => Your function output =>  [1,2,3,4,4,7,8]

 

    - [], [2,4,9] => Your function output => [2,4,9]

 

    - [1,2,7,8] , [2,5,9,14]  => Your function output =>  [1,2,2,5,7,8, 9, 14]
 

    
## Things I learned from this Challenge

- I learned and practised how to check if parameter is an array

- Other knowledge used in the task is from Day 7 task which is to sort an array.
