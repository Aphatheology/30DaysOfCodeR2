# Pascal's Triangle

## Create a function that takes an integer input. This integer represents the number of rows of the pascal’s triangle you are to return. Your function should return an array of arrays with each array containing the numbers on its corresponding row of the Pascal’s Triangle in the right order.


- For example: 

    - 1  => Your function output =>  [[1]] 

    - 3 => Your function output => [[1], [1,1], [1,2,1]]

    - 4 => Your function output => [[1], [1,1], [1,2,1], [1,3,3,1]]

 

## Things I learned from this Challenge

- I researched and read different solutions to Pascal Triangle but I am yet to fully write my own pseudo code to solve it.
