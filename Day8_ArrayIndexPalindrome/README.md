## Create a function that takes an array of strings. Your function should return a corresponding array that tells us if the string at this index is a palindrome or not.

### A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward as it does backwards e.g madam, racecar, ada, bob

- For example: 

    - [racecar,abcd,bab,kala,madam, carac]  
        - The function output =>  [true, false, true, false, true, true]

    - [bad, good, evil] 
        - The function output => [false, false, false]
 

## Things I learned from this Challenge

- I learned and practised how to reverse a string with in built functions

- I practiced ternary operator
